Array of user defined size (x*x)

User defines walls as well as possible camera placement points

Program finds all empty points and uniformly distributes checkpoints alongside them.

User can choose to add more checkpoint so that the area is considered more important by the system

Program executes a greedy algorithm, attempting to find camera position with the largest number of covered checkpoints

Complexity = n^2 (Fill points uniformly) + (k*c) Find camera positions for all the locations

Where 
n = grid size
k = all camera points
c = number of cameras	

Camera determines its score by calculating all the sample points:
Point is only detected by evaluated camera: +1 
Point is not detected: 0
Point is detected by 1 or more different cameras: -1 for each given camera

Additional metrics can be specified such as anti-vandalism measure, giving each camera a high score when considering placement. This ensures every camera is watched by at least one different camera.
